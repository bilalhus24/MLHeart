# Heart Disease Classification Project

This project explores various **classification techniques** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the **Heart Disease dataset** from Kaggle. It compares the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective model.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle ([Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/))
- The dataset contains features related to patients' health and clinical measurements to predict heart disease risk.

---

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
The following classification algorithms were implemented and tested:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Random Forest**

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
   - Handled missing values and normalized numerical features where required.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identified and selected relevant features for model training.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trained models using the listed techniques.
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Compared results across all models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

---

## Results
- The models showed varying levels of performance based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- **Random Forest** provided the most robust results with high accuracy and F1-score.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms and evaluation
